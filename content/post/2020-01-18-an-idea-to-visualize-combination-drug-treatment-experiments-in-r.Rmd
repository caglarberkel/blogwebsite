<div style="text-align: justify">

Recently, I have been thinking on how to visualize my experimental data where I performed combination drug treatments on certain cancer cell lines, for a paper I am writing. In short, I used two different inhibitor molecules alone or in combination, and measured a response variable (percent cell viability in my case). First, I drew side-by-side boxplots for each case (drugs alone in different concentrations and drugs in combination applied with previously selected concentrations) using ggplot and I thought it was not so easy for the reader to interpret the data as he/she should be. Then, while I was reading Hands-On Machine Learning with R [https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/] by Bradley Boehmke & Brandon Greenwell, I got an idea on how to better visualize my data. I decided to use scatter3D function in plot3D R package. Here is an example of one of my figures and the code chunk to produce this 3D plot:

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(plot3D)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
# read experimental data into R from excel file

SRBdata <- read_excel("/Users/caglarberkel/Desktop/LAB/Experiment data/SRB data/CIS_BOR_OLA_all cells_SRB data.xlsx")
```

```{r, fig.align='center', eval=FALSE}

# filter certain drugs, certain concentrations and a particular cell line

df1 <- SRBdata %>% filter(CIS == 0) %>% filter(BOR == 0 | BOR == 10 | BOR == 20) %>% 
                   filter(OLA == 0 | OLA == 10 | OLA == 20) %>% 
                   filter(cellline == "OV2008") 

# define response (z) and predictor variables (x and y)

x <- df1$BOR
y <- df1$OLA
z <- df1$viability

# fit data using a linear model

fit <- lm(z ~ x + y)

grid.lines = 25

x.pred <- seq(min(x), max(x), length.out = grid.lines)
y.pred <- seq(min(y), max(y), length.out = grid.lines)

xy <- expand.grid(x = x.pred, y = y.pred)

z.pred <- matrix(predict(fit, newdata = xy), nrow = grid.lines, ncol = grid.lines)

fitpoints <- predict(fit)

scatter3D(x, y, z, pch = 18, cex = 2, 
           theta = 45, phi = 45, ticktype = "detailed",
           xlab = "BOR", ylab = "OLA", zlab = "% viability",  
           surf = list(x = x.pred, y = y.pred, z = z.pred,  
                       facets = NA, fit = fitpoints), main = "OV2008 cell line")
```

```{r}
